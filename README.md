# Bank

This is a basic frontend for a toy bank app. It uses 4 mock accounts and supports some basic bank functionality:

- Transfers
- Loan requests
- Account closures

You can play around with the following credentials:

- account 1 username: _ns_
- account 1 password: _1111_
- account 2 username: _ea_
- account 2 password: _2222_

The base (`index.html`, `style.css`, some selectors declared in `script.js`) is part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, however this is an exercise project and so the version of the app found in this repo has some personal touches and:

- is in dark instead of light mode
- uses a different bank logo (taken from [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bank_2830284?term=banking&page=1&position=5&page=1&position=5&related_id=2830284&origin=tag))
- has some extra alert windows
- may have functionality written differently than what shown in the course
